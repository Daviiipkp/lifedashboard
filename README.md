> **LifeDashboard** is a full-stack productivity suite designed to track metrics that are important for anyone (like water intake or meals) and metrics that might be important to you (like coding, language learning, reading or studying)

**Backend:** Java (Spring Boot)

**Frontend:** React (https://github.com/Daviiipkp/lifedashboard-frontend)

**Database:** PostgreSQL/H2

**Security:** REST API


Note about how I came up with this:
Well, the idea for this came when I realized that I used to forget some daily habits that I really wanted to stick to. First I installed some productivity apps that really didn’t please me (specially for not having a way to keep “Streaks” of your habits)
When I realized that I could make my own, I started learning (yeah, there’s a lot of learning and reworking hours in this project) and tinkering, which actually made me very happy with the freedom I had.
Anyway, we have streaks for everyday life things (like meals, which is cool for people that workout), we have leetcode streaks (that searches for your profile based on the nick that you registered with. plan o changing that obviously) and we have reading, planning and studying as ways of keeping your mental health and routine.
I plan on making every streak editable and adding services for other platforms (like brilliant).
